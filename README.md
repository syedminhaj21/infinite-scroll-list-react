### Infinite-scroll-list-react
If you are looking for an alternative to pagination then you should consider infinite scroll. In modern UI/UX development infinite scroll provides a better user experience as the user does not have to move between screens, he can scroll endlessly to view the data being on the same page.
This is a demonstration of infinite scroll implemented with **HTML Observer api** and React v17 using latest React techniques such as **Hooks** - **useEffect, useState, useRef** etc.
*Please note - There is a mock login interface implemented with username as 'foo' and password as 'bar'.
